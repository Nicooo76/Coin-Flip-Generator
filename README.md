## 🧠 How It Works

The Coin Flip Generator simulates a real coin toss using a random function that
returns either Heads or Tails with equal probability.

Each flip follows this process:
1. Fast initial spin animation
2. Gradual slowdown for a realistic effect
3. Randomly selected final result
4. Result is stored in the history list

This makes the generator ideal for:
- Quick decision making
- Games and challenges
- Classroom demonstrations
- UI and animation demos
- Simple randomness testing
